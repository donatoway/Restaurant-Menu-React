this webapp allows you to view international dishes divided into categories. On the home page you will find the selection of the different cuisine categories and 2 sections: "the most popular dishes" and "Pasta". Each Card refers to the technical sheet of the dish. All API calls are handled through spoonacular.com which returns any information and images relating to the dishes. The dishes are set randomly.
